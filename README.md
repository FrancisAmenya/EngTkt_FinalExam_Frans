Let's see what this project actually is made up of...

1. Its a java based application wrapped as an exe. 

2. It has a swing java UI, if you don't know what this is, please refer to https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/uiswing/ .

##### Classes Inside are: 

- _GameUI.java_ -       this is the heart of the application, where all the magic works. It's the main class...for those curious coders.|
- `Aboutdialog.java` -  this is a class that supports the main class by decluttering it, it stores details about the application creator and a brief summary about the application.|
- 'HelpDialog.java' -   this is where you seek help about playing the game. All instructions, cheat codes and a secret map of China are hidden here.
